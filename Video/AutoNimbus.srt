00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:01,100
When I learnt driving,

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,500
my dad helped me change gears

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,100
and helped me become a better driver.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,100
But the learning curve stopped there.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,500
Although, this seems to be a trivial problem,

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,100
it avalanches into a problem of environmental and national concern,

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,500
where thousands of litres of fuel are wasted

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,400
worth lakhs of rupees.

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,000
There's always advancement in technology with time

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
but what we see on the road,

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,600
is a technology of the past.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,800
So, we wanted to make changes to the 

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,300
very fundamental element of the driving hierarchy.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
So what if there was someone

15
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,000
to fill the shoes of a driving expert,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,400
sitting next to you, guiding you,

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
monitoring your car's health all the time,

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,900
saving you from having a huge dent in your pocket.

18
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,300
But, this seems to converge to a simple solution

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,900
of having a driving assistant,

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,100
which is no different from a rulebook.

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,100
But what we are dealing with is a real-time problem

22
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,700
which requires real-time data analysed

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,400
taking all possible factors into consideration

24
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
which a normal rulebook cannot do.

25
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,500
This is where we came up with the idea of AutoNimbus

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
where data collected from a car using On-Board Diagnostics

27
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
is directly sent to the cloud,

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
processed using optimized machine learning algorithms

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,000
is fed back to the user as useful information.

30
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Speed-breaker detection, Road condition detection

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,900
Fault detection system, advanced Fleet Mangagement System (FMS)

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
Gear recommendation and best-route calculation

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
are minute, but significant things that can

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
completely rewire the way we drive

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
and go one level up in increasing fuel efficiency


35
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
and drastically bring down fuel and maintenance costs.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,300
Adding to that, on a larger scale,

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,700
it even brings down traffic congestion to a larger extent

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,900
resulting in more organized and safer roads

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,000
saving more time and fuel.

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,500
All these recommendations are fed to the user

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
using a smart-phone application

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
thus, completing the whole cycle.

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,300
Rolling out this idea on a large scale,

44
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,000
stresses on the need for a more reliable,

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,150
secure and robust OBD Scanner

46
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,200
which can connect directly to the cloud

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
in addition to having a more reliable and

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
stable system on the cloud.

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,500
We are planning to make such proprietary OBDs

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,300
and have tie-ups with all auto-majors

51
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,500
to reach out with the masses and to

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,300
bring about a complete change on Indian roads.
