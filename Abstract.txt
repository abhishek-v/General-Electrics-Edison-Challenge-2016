Scope in the market:
Pollution and climate change is the talk of the town. Reducing vehicular emissions is a key aspect in this regard, the new rules tested by government of our national capital emphasises the same. In addition to the fact that reduction in fuel usages keeps the environment clean, it reduces the fuel expenses and attracts wide range of users - both individuals and organizations.



Target audience/Beneficiaries:
1. Transportation industry:
Government transport corporations and private transport services will be benefited greatly with savings from fuel expenses. 

2.The general public:

Commuters of public transport can get real time information about its availability and effectiveness, by suggesting various other means such as car pooling.
Car pooling attracts more people who don't prefer public transport and helps to effectively utilize time, money and fuel. 

Individual vehicle owners can adjust to real time traffic and be aware of best practices when driving through different routes and road conditions. This not only works with cars or trucks, it even applies for bikes.
